Log of stuff to be done.

Fix player textures. 
Shadow plane orientation. 
Drawflat/lightmap/fullbright/triangles/bboxes crap. 
Host timers. 
Remove non-SDL2 stuff.
Move sounds to hunk & remove cache memory.
Different move speed with vsync on or off. 
.vis file support
Extra dynamic lights (but needs a check for AD overloading/abusing trail types).
Green dynamic light is too bright???
Separate cshift for cshift command
Get rid of max_edicts cvar (retain it for familiarity/assurance/comfort-blanket, but edicts to be unbounded).
add sv_novis cvar
