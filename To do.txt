Log of stuff to be done.

Shadow plane orientation.  
Remove non-SDL2 stuff.
Move sounds to hunk & remove cache memory.
Green dynamic light is too bright???
r_speeds counters are no longer really relevant; dlights can go, draw calls needs to go in, etc.
Optional primitive restart
Detect dx10 gpu for npot robustness

Can SDL2 resize without deleting and recreating the context?  Every time I need to use the TexMgr code I just want to rip it to pieces and rewrite, and this would enable me to do a huge simplification pass.
