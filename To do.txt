Log of stuff to be done.

Fix player textures. 
Shadow plane orientation. 
Drawflat/lightmap/fullbright/triangles/bboxes crap. 
Remove non-SDL2 stuff.
Move sounds to hunk & remove cache memory.
Green dynamic light is too bright???
add sv_novis cvar
r_speeds counters are no longer really relevant; dlights can go, draw calls needs to go in, etc.
Optional primitive restart
Detect dx10 gpu for npot robustness

Drawflat idea - Software Quake used ((int) s->data & 0xff) for a palette index.  FQ/QS used the polygon pointer as a random number seed.
Make 256 1x1 textures - 1 for each palette index.  Some surface property - and it could be a random number - gives the texture to use.
How to implement with MDLs?

Other idea - add a "flatcolor" property to each triangle in everything.  This would bring brushpolyvert_t to 32-byte and add 4 bytes to MDLs.
