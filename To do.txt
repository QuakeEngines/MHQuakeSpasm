Log of stuff to be done.

Shadow plane orientation.  
Remove non-SDL2 stuff.
Move sounds to hunk & remove cache memory.
Green dynamic light is too bright???
r_speeds counters are no longer really relevant; dlights can go, draw calls needs to go in, etc.
Optional primitive restart
Detect dx10 gpu for npot robustness
Programmatically reconstruct r_avertexnormals. It's just an icosahedron with 2 or 3 levels of subdivision. The order would be wrong but that doesn't matter because we build alias normals properly now. 
Put AD particles through particle system! 
Static entity lightpoint optimization.
